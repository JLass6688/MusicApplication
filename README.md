###Timeline
####Planning
1) *Ideation / Problem Identification & Solving* - the only phase of the planning process was formulating and expanding on ideas. I knew I wanted this application to be geared towards something I was passionate about, so music was an easy decision. Being an avid fan of music, I identified several problems that I faced when browser for information about artists. I realized that the most prominent issue was the lack of an aggregation of informaiton about music artists. My solution was to this issue was to create an application that, through the use of API's, pulled in all of the information into one, centralized location. 

####UX Design
1) *Wireframing* - the first phase of the UX process was to sketch out a rough, low-fidelity wireframe of my application. This would allow me to determine necessary features, user-flow, and a rough overview of my application.
#####
2) *Branding* - the second phase of the UX process was to create a brand for my application. I wanted to be colorful, playful, but bold. I determined the central theme of my application to be music and discovery, hence the name Apollo.
#####
3) *Designing* - the final phase of the UX process was to conceptualize, design, and save out my design assets (including icons, logos, transitions, and backgrounds). I utilized Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop for this process, making sure to save out my design assets to allow access to the Asset Pipeline. 

####Development
After I had planned out my application, designed the layout and necessary assets, it was time to develop the application. The technology I used is described in the next section.
